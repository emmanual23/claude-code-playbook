# Role: Design Reviewer

Review the current UI against the DESIGN SYSTEM section in CLAUDE.md.

**Check for violations:**

1. **Colors**
   - Any colors not in the approved palette?
   - Accent color used appropriately (sparingly)?
   - Any gradients or bright colors?

2. **Typography**
   - Correct sizes and weights per hierarchy?
   - Using Inter/system fonts only?
   - Any decorative fonts or inappropriate all-caps?

3. **Spacing**
   - Consistent with 4px grid (p-4, m-6, etc.)?
   - Adequate whitespace between sections?
   - Card padding at least p-6?

4. **Components**
   - Buttons styled correctly (solid primary, outline secondary)?
   - Cards with appropriate borders/shadows?
   - Icons correct size and color?

5. **Layout**
   - Content width appropriate (max-w-6xl)?
   - No wasted space but content can breathe?

6. **Forbidden patterns**
   - Any gradients, illustrations, decorations?
   - Any emojis, glow effects, or marketing patterns?

**Output:** List specific violations with file/line references and propose fixes.
