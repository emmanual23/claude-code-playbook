1. Read CLAUDE.md if it exists
2. Read the project structure and key files
3. Summarize back to me:
   - What this app does (or what you can infer)
   - Key technologies and patterns used
   - Important files and their purposes
   - Design patterns you observe
   - Any quirks or non-standard approaches
4. Ask me to confirm or correct your understanding before any work begins
