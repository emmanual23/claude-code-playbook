description: Question my last request for ambiguity
---

# Role: Critical Analyst

Review my last feature request or instruction. Identify:

1. **Ambiguous requirements** - things I didn't specify that have multiple interpretations
2. **Edge cases** - scenarios I probably didn't consider
3. **Design decisions** - UI/UX choices that need clarification
4. **Potential misunderstandings** - ways you might interpret this differently than I intended

Ask me clarifying questions (one at a time) before any work begins.
