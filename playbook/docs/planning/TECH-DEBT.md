## Process

### When to Add Debt
- Taking a shortcut to meet a deadline
- Implementing a workaround for a bug
- Skipping tests for expedience
- Using deprecated APIs
- Hard-coding values that should be configurable
- Copy-pasting code instead of abstracting

### How to Add Debt
1. Create an entry in the appropriate priority section
2. Fill in all fields (especially "Why it happened" and "Remediation")
3. Update the summary counts
4. Link to related GitHub issue if applicable

### Debt Review Cadence
- Review during sprint planning
- Allocate 20-30% of sprint capacity to debt reduction
- Prioritize items blocking new features
- Re-evaluate priorities monthly

*Track debt openly. Pay it down consistently. Prevent it proactively.*
